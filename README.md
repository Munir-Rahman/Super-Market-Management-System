# 📦 Product Management App (Pashto Interface)

A simple and responsive Product Management App built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The app interface and all messages are written in **Pashto**, making it easy for native Pashto speakers to use.  
Users can **add**, **edit**, **delete**, and **search** for products. It also includes **low stock alerts** and **real-time notifications**, with data saved using `localStorage`.
